## Purpose
The purpose of this work instructions is to document the assembly process of creating a customer salable `staging-plate kit`

## Instructions

### Prepare staging-plate
* Collect a `staging-plate` from inventory
* Clean both sides of each `staging-plate` with an IPA-soaked shop rag to remove dust and scuffs
* Inspect for defects/damage on the top and bottom surfaces of the PCB
	* Reference the [Opulo Cosmetic Quality Standards documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vblE59KeiyKYdd655MeTJDzQi4rJhu8tgH3RU7gAahY/edit?usp=sharing)
	* Bring anything that’s debatable to a manager for a judgment call

### Prepare Staging Plate Attachment Hardware set

	* 4x `M5x8mm-button-head`
	* 4x `M5-tslot-nut`

### Plastic wrap the staging plate(s) and hardware bags
* Wrap the `staging-plate` in three wraps of plastic wrap
* After the third wrap, fold the excess plastic wrap inward
* Place `staging-plate-attachment-hardware-set` atop the `staging-plate`
* Give the bundle of components a final wrap to secure everything
* Cut the wrapped bundle away from the plastic wrap spool 
* Fold the excess cling wrap onto the bundle for a final time
* Pat the plastic wrap down to smooth out any creases and firm up the bond

!!!Note "If customer ordered 2 or more `staging-plate`"
	It is acceptable to bundle multiple staging plates atop each other in the plastic wrap, but be sure to add all `staging-plate-attachment-hardware-set` pieces in the same layer.

### Prepare aux-staging-plate-foot
* Check either the `Opulo Shopify Store - Coefficient Data Steam` or the week's fulfillment paperwork to determine what version of the `aux-staging-plate-foot` to include
	* The `Title + Variant` field will denote whether you should use a ≤`v3.0.4`, `v3.0.5`, or `v3.1+` version of `aux-staging-plate-foot`

* Once you have identified the correct version of `aux-staging-plate-foot` to use, collect the unprocessed 3D print from the relevant container for use in the next step

* See [here](/lumen/additional-parts/#aux-staging-plate-foot) for guidance on assembling the `aux-staging-plate-foot`
	
	!!!warning "Skip the `rubber-foot` if the version is `≤v3.0.4`"

### Prepare Packaging
* Fold staging plate box
* Cut 4x foam sheets into 6"x4" sections
* Place 2x 6"x4" pieces of foam on both sides of the open box
* Place wrapped up `staging-plate` and `aux-staging-plate-foot` above the foam sheet
	* Be sure to include as many pieces of `aux-staging-plate-foot` as there are `staging-plate` in the order
* Add 2x additional pieces of 6"x4" foam on both sides of the open box
* Add any other additional items to the package before taping box shut for fulfillment
