	-  limit-switch-board [`PCA-0002-00`] - Without opening the vendor provided bag, actuate the switch to ensure that it clicks properly

		!!! warning "If a limit-switch-board does not seem correct when actuated, either audibly or tactually, bring it to MRB"
			
	-  Packaged Datum Board [`ASM-0024-00`] - Place a datum-board and Opulo Logo Sticker into a 2 1/2" x 3" Reclosable Bag

12. Close the esd-safe-mailer
13. Write the following information on the box's front face with a silver permanent marker:
	- The last 3 digits of the motherboard serial number
	- The given LumenPnP PCB Kit (Salable) [`SKU-0003-02`] production build number
	!!! warning "If the build number is not known, please ask for assistance"
