Open Hardware Assembly Instructions for products made by Opulo Inc.
!!! note
	These instructions are maintained by and for the Opulo Manufacturing Team, and will specify the use of tools that are not part of a regular LumenPnP tool kit, including custom assembly jigs and QC equipment. We are constantly improving our production processes and do our best to keep these instructions up-to-date, however our team may deviate from these docs as needed.
