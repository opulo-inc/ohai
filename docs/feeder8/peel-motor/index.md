# Peel Motor Assembly

This section will guide the reader on how to properly glue the `worm-gear` onto the shaft of a `peel-motor` to create `peel-motor-asm`.

## Setup
Material needed 

* `LOCTITE 435` 
* `worm-gear`
* `peel-motor`

<!-- add photo of all the the items needed. ALso don't know why the fuck it ain't bulletin boarding it.  -->

## QC Worm Gears

!!! Note "Not all `worm-gears` are printed consistently."

* `worm-gears` should have a consistent even spiral throughout. It is to make sure that the `peel-gear` teeth can move within the `worm-gear` grooves.

!!! success "A beautiful `worm-gear`!"

!!! failure "Nasty boy `worm-gear`!"

* run a `peel-gear` manually through the grooves of the `worm-gear` to confirm that in can run through without resistance.

* This gear is ready to be glued! 

## Assembly 
	
* Dispense a 1-2 drops of `LOCTITE 435` to the end of shaft on `peel-motor`.

* Bring `peel-motor` shaft to hole of `worm-gear` and firmly bring pieces together.

<!-- just shove it in there pic -->

* Place the `peel-motor-asm` on side or on head of `peel-motor` to dry.

* Manually rotate the installed `peel-gear` to check if any glue fell into the motor's gearbox once it's dried for at least 3 minutes. 

!!!failure "If you cannot rotate the installed `peel-gear` by hand, scrap the subassembly and record the material waste"
	
!!!success "Move the completed `peel-motor-asm` to the corresponding storage bin at the feeder assembly workstation"
