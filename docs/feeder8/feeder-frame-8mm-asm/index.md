# 8mm Feeder Frame Assembly
This section will guide the reader through the process of installing various hardware components into `feeder-frame-8mm` in preparation for its use in final assembly.

## Prepare `feeder-frame-8mm` 
* Inspect the print for defects
	* Use a heat gun to remove any stringing
	* Check the first layer to ensure it is free of defects and printed on the tuxtured print bed as shown

	* Firmly press the up and down buttons so that they can move freely
	

	!!! note "Note on button handling"
		* These buttons are print-in-place flexures, which means they need to be broken away from the layer of plastic between them and the rest of `feeder-frame-8mm` 
			* Exercise care here, as pressing these buttons too far inward can break them
		* The motherboard that is installed later will prevent this type of button over-travel damage

* Inspect for loose plastic in the overhanging region of the pick-window on the `feeder-frame-8mm`
	* Remove any loose plastic with a knife as needed

## Install Light Diffuser
* Use an `arbor-press-jig` to install `light-diffuser-pcb (PCB-0013-01)` into `feeder-frame-8mm`
	* The Opulo logo on `light-diffuser-pcb` should be in the correct orientation when the feeder is held in front of you

* The installed `light-diffuser-pcb` should be flush to the top-face of `feeder-frame-8mm` when installed correctly

## Install 8mm Fiducial Board
* Add a small amount of `LOCTITE 435` in the front pocket of the `feeder-frame-8mm`

* Manually install `8mm-fiducial-board` into the front pocket of `feeder-frame-8mm`
	*  The fiducial markers should remain visible when installed

* Orient `feeder-frame-8mm` upright for 30 minutes to allow `LOCTITE 435` time to cure
