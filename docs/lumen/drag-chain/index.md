## Prepare `cable-splay` ##

- Insert 2x `M5-square-nut` into `cable-splay`
	- Glue is not required even if the fit is loose

## OQC Checks ##

* Inspect the *cable-splay* side of `drag-chain` and confirm the following cables are present and installed in the correct direction

	*  `LM` cable: 6-pin connector with a <span style="background-color:red">**red**</span>`LM` label
	*  `RM` cable: 6-pin connector with a <span style="background-color:blue">**blue**</span> `RM` label

* Confirm the following vacuum tubes are present at both ends:
	*  	<span style="background-color:red">**Red**</span> `4mm-pneumatic-tubing`
	*  	<span style="background-color:blue">**Blue**</span> `4mm-pneumatic-tubing`

* Confirm no vacuum tubes are pinched closed by the rubber banding
* Confirm 3x `zip-tie` used in `cable-splay` are trimmed flush and present
* Confirm presence of `top-camera-cable`
* Confirm presence of `x-harness` and double check that `x-harness` has the correct orientation
