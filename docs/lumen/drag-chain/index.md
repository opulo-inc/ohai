# Drag Chain Assembly #

This section will guide the reader on how to properly assemble the LumenPNP v4 Drag Chain Assembly.

## QC Harnesses ##

Before assembling the drag chain, QC the individual cable harnesses from the manufacturer.

- Head Harness
    - Labels are all correct
        ![bad label](img/wrong-label.webp)
    - Colors on head side are correct
		![](img/color-labels.webp)
    - `Z MOTOR`, `L MOTOR`, and `R MOTOR` cables have inner conductors swapped on the head side only.
		![](img/inner-swapped.webp)
	- `Z MOTOR`, `L MOTOR`, and `R MOTOR` connectors skips positions 2 and 5 on the head side only.
		![](img/skip-2-5.webp)
    - All crimps are fully loaded
    	![](img/not-seated.webp)
    - No loose conductors/Exposed wire
    	![](img/bad-crimp.webp)
- X Gantry
    - `X MOTOR` connector has inner conductors swapped gantry side only.

    - No loose conductors/Exposed wire

## Prepare `cable-splay` ##

- Insert 2x `M5-square-nut` into `cable-splay`
	- Glue is not required even if the fit is loose

## QC Crimps ##
Inspect the cables for any loose crimps, reworking as needed, before continuing

## OQC Checks ##

* Inspect the *cable-splay* side of `drag-chain` and confirm the following cables are present and installed in the correct direction

	*  `LM` cable: 6-pin connector with a <span style="background-color:red">**red**</span>`LM` label
	*  `RM` cable: 6-pin connector with a <span style="background-color:blue">**blue**</span> `RM` label

* Confirm the following vacuum tubes are present at both ends:
	*  	<span style="background-color:red">**Red**</span> `4mm-pneumatic-tubing`
	*  	<span style="background-color:blue">**Blue**</span> `4mm-pneumatic-tubing`

* Confirm no vacuum tubes are pinched closed by the rubber banding
* Confirm 3x `zip-tie` used in `cable-splay` are trimmed flush and present
* Confirm presence of `top-camera-cable`
* Confirm presence of `x-harness` and double check that `x-harness` has the correct orientation
